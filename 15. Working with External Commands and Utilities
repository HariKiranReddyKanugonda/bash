### Working with External Commands and Utilities in Bash Scripting

In Bash scripting, **external commands** and **utilities** are essential tools that allow scripts to interact with the underlying system, manipulate files, process data, and perform complex operations. Bash scripts rely heavily on these external utilities because they offer powerful functionalities that can be integrated into the script to accomplish various tasks.

### Overview

- **External commands** refer to programs that are not built into the shell, but are available on the system. These commands reside in files (usually in directories like `/bin`, `/usr/bin`, or `/sbin`) and can be executed from within a script.
- **Utilities** are software tools designed to perform specific tasks. They range from simple commands like `ls` to more complex ones like `awk`, `sed`, and `grep`.

Working with external commands and utilities allows you to make your Bash scripts much more powerful and versatile. These utilities provide functionality that would be difficult or time-consuming to implement in pure Bash.

### 1. **Calling External Commands in Bash Scripts**

External commands can be invoked just like regular commands in the terminal, using their name followed by any required arguments. When you call an external command in a Bash script, the shell executes it as a separate process.

#### Example:

#!/bin/bash
# Example of calling external commands in a Bash script

echo "Listing files in the current directory:"
ls -l


Here, the `ls` command is an external command that is used to list files in the current directory.

### 2. **Handling Command Output**

Most external commands produce output, either to **standard output (stdout)** or **standard error (stderr)**. You can capture and use this output in your script.

#### a. **Capturing Output with Backticks (Legacy)**

You can capture the output of an external command using backticks (`` `command` ``). This was the traditional way, but it has been mostly replaced by `$()` for readability.

Example:

#!/bin/bash
# Capturing command output using backticks
current_date=`date`
echo "Today's date is: $current_date"


#### b. **Capturing Output with `$()` (Modern)**

The `$()` syntax is the modern and preferred way to capture the output of a command. It improves readability and allows for nested commands.

Example:

#!/bin/bash
# Capturing command output using $()
current_date=$(date)
echo "Today's date is: $current_date"


#### c. **Redirecting Output to Files**

You can redirect the output of an external command to a file using `>`, `>>`, or `tee`.

- `>`: Redirects output to a file, overwriting the file if it already exists.
- `>>`: Appends output to a file, without overwriting.
- `tee`: Redirects output to both a file and the terminal (useful for logging and debugging).

Example:

#!/bin/bash
# Redirecting command output to a file
ls -l > output.txt  # Overwrites the file output.txt

# Appending command output to a file
echo "This is a new entry" >> output.txt

# Using tee to send output to both the terminal and a file
ls -l | tee output.txt


---

### 3. **Handling Command Exit Status**

Each external command returns an **exit status** (also known as a return code or exit code). The exit status indicates whether the command was successful or encountered an error. A status of `0` indicates success, while any non-zero value indicates failure.

You can capture the exit status using the special variable `$?`.

#### Example:

#!/bin/bash
# Checking the exit status of a command
echo "Running a command..."
ls /nonexistent_directory  # This command will fail

# Check if the command was successful
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "The command was successful."
else
    echo "The command failed."
fi


- **$?** holds the exit status of the last executed command.
- If `ls /nonexistent_directory` fails, the exit status will be non-zero, and the script will print "The command failed."

---

### 4. **Using External Utilities**

Bash scripting can interact with a variety of external utilities to perform text processing, file manipulation, system monitoring, and more.

Some commonly used utilities include:

- **`echo`**: Outputs text to the screen.
- **`cat`**: Displays the contents of a file.
- **`grep`**: Searches for patterns in files or input streams.
- **`sed`**: Stream editor for modifying text in a pipeline.
- **`awk`**: A powerful text processing tool, often used for column-based operations.
- **`find`**: Searches for files and directories in the file system.
- **`cut`**: Cuts sections from each line of input data.
- **`sort`**: Sorts lines of text.
- **`tar`**: Compresses or decompresses archive files.

#### Example with `grep`:

#!/bin/bash
# Using grep to search for a pattern in a file
grep "error" /var/log/syslog  # Search for the word "error" in the syslog file


#### Example with `awk`:

#!/bin/bash
# Using awk to print the first column of a file
awk '{print $1}' /etc/passwd  # Print the first field (username) from the passwd file


---

### 5. **Working with Pipes and Redirection**

Bash allows you to combine external commands using **pipes (`|`)** and **redirection (`>`, `>>`)**. This allows you to pass the output of one command to the input of another.

#### a. **Pipes (`|`)**

A pipe sends the output of one command directly into another command as input. This allows you to chain commands together.

Example:

#!/bin/bash
# Using pipes to pass output between commands
ps aux | grep "bash"  # List all processes and search for the word "bash"


#### b. **Redirection (`>`, `>>`)**

- **`>`**: Redirects the output of a command to a file, overwriting the file if it already exists.
- **`>>`**: Appends the output to the end of the file.

Example:

#!/bin/bash
# Redirecting output to a file
ls -l > directory_list.txt  # Overwrites the file directory_list.txt

# Appending to a file
echo "New entry" >> directory_list.txt  # Appends text to the file


---

### 6. **Background Execution and Job Control**

In Bash, you can run external commands in the **background** using the `&` symbol. This allows the script to continue running other tasks without waiting for the command to finish.

#### Example:

#!/bin/bash
# Running a command in the background
sleep 10 &  # Runs sleep in the background
echo "Sleep command is running in the background."


You can use the `jobs` command to view background jobs and `fg` to bring a background job to the foreground.

#### Example:

# View background jobs
jobs

# Bring a job to the foreground
fg %1  # Brings job 1 to the foreground


---

### 7. **Working with Command Line Arguments in Scripts**

External commands can take command-line arguments, and Bash scripts can pass these arguments when invoking the commands.

#### Example:

#!/bin/bash
# A script that accepts command-line arguments
echo "First argument: $1"
echo "Second argument: $2"
echo "All arguments: $@"


When running the script:

./myscript.sh arg1 arg2


Output:

First argument: arg1
Second argument: arg2
All arguments: arg1 arg2


---

### 8. **Handling Errors with External Commands**

You can handle errors from external commands by checking their exit status or using error-redirection to capture and log error messages.

#### Example:

#!/bin/bash
# Running an external command and checking for errors
cp /source/file /destination/file
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Error occurred while copying file" >> error.log
else
    echo "File copied successfully"
fi


---

### 9. **Using `xargs` to Build and Execute Commands**

The `xargs` command is often used to take input from another command and execute it as a new command.

Example:

#!/bin/bash
# Using xargs to delete files
find . -name "*.log" | xargs rm  # Find and delete all .log files


This example finds all `.log` files and then deletes them using `xargs`.

---
