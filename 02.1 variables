Defining Variables:
In Bash, variables are defined by simply assigning a value to a name. #name="Alice" 
No spaces are allowed around the equal sign (=).  #age=25
Variable names should only contain letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), and underscores (_).
Variable names cannot start with a number.

Accessing Variable Values:
To access the value stored in a variable, we use the dollar sign ($) followed by the variable name #echo $name 
we can also use curly braces to access variables in more complex expression  #echo "Name: ${name}, Age: ${age}"  # Prints: Name: Alice, Age: 25

Types of Variables
Bash supports several types of variables, though they are all essentially strings under the hood. These are:
Local Variables: Variables defined in a script or function and are accessible only within that scope.  #name="Alice"   # Local variable
Global Variables: Variables defined outside any function, which are accessible throughout the entire script.
Environment Variables: Variables that are available to processes spawned by the script. we can make a variable available globally by exporting it.
Special Variables: Bash has several predefined variables that hold special meanings. 
For example:
$? – The exit status of the last command executed.
$# – The number of arguments passed to the script or function.
$0 – The name of the script itself.
$1, $2, ..., $n – Positional parameters for the arguments passed to a script or function.
$* and $@ – All the arguments passed to the script.

Using Variables in Commands
Variables can be used within commands by referencing them with $. This is useful when passing dynamic values to commands, such as file paths or user input

Variable Substitution
Bash supports variable substitution, where the value of a variable can be substituted in place of the variable name

Reading User Input
we can assign user input to a variable using the read command #read -p "Enter your name: " name

Working with Arrays
Bash allows us to work with arrays, which are essentially variables that hold multiple values.

Read-Only Variables
You can make a variable read-only, meaning it can't be modified after being set #readonly pi=3.14

Arithmetic Operations
Bash allows you to perform arithmetic operations using the $(( )) syntax:
#a=10
#b=5
#sum=$((a + b))   # Adds a and b
#echo $sum        # Prints: 15

String Operations
Concatenating Strings: You can concatenate strings by simply placing them next to each other
String Length: Use ${#variable} to get the length of a string
Substring: You can extract substrings using ${variable:start:length}

Unsetting Variables
We can delete a variable using the unset command

Variable Expansion (Advanced)
Bash also supports advanced variable expansion techniques. Here are some examples:
Default Value: If a variable is unset or null, use a default value  #echo ${name:-"Default Name"}  # Prints Default Name if $name is not set
Assign Default Value: If a variable is unset or null, assign a default value  #name=${name:-"Default Name"}  # Assigns Default Name if $name is not set
Remove Leading/Trailing Whitespaces.  #var="  Hello  " #echo "${var// /}"  # Removes all spaces







Defining Variables: Use variable_name="value".
Accessing Variables: Use $variable_name.
No Spaces Around = when defining variables.
Array Variables: Hold multiple values, accessed with ${array[index]}.
Environment Variables: Made available to child processes using export.
Arithmetic Operations: Use $(( )) for arithmetic calculations.
String Operations: Can concatenate, find lengths, and extract substrings.
Advanced Expansion: Useful for setting default values and trimming spaces.


Example Script Using Variables:
bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define variables
greeting="Hello"
name="World"

# Concatenate strings
full_message="$greeting, $name!"

# Display the message
echo $full_message  # Outputs: Hello, World!

# Perform arithmetic
num1=5
num2=3
sum=$((num1 + num2))
echo "The sum of $num1 and $num2 is $sum."  # Outputs: The sum of 5 and 3 is 8.

# Read user input
read -p "Enter your favorite color: " color
echo "Your favorite color is $color."
